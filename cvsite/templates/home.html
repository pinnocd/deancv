			I transferred to the Development Team to work as a SQL developer writing reports for client investment guidelines.  After a while I moved to work on automating the deployment process and entered the world of DevOps while the team was transitioning to Agile project management.  I worked on building a CI/CD pipeline which had code hosted on Github with the branching strategy monitored using Sourcetree.  The TFS builds (triggered from pushes to the repo) incorporated automatic testing and stages that needed user approval along the way, before being deployed using Octopus Deploy to any number of 10 environments which included databases, services and UIs.  I worked closely with the development, testing, support and release control teams to ensure clean and efficient releases and helped to reduce the delivery cycle from once every 2 weeks to twice a week. Upon completion of the main DevOps project I began UI development, adding new screens and npm controls to an Angular 5 reporting system which included embedded Tableau reports. I worked with Fixed Income analysts, gathering and prioritising requirements, then implemented changes to the C#, Javascript, Typescript and SQL Server code.

			Worked in Asset Management at Schroders where I provided front office, 1st line support for the Fixed Income and Multi-Asset desks.  I worked mainly supporting FIA (Fixed Income Analytics), a custom-made application which allowed Fund Managers and other interested parties, to accurately model portfolios and monitor their performance over time, based on analytic data from several external vendors (e.g. MarkIT, Barcap, ML).  As the system was built using the Microsoft toolset, I was able to leverage my knowledge of SQL Server/SSIS/SSRS, debug the production application and write code to help the rest of the support team perform daily tasks.  For the last year I lead an offshore team and moved to level 3 support, tasked with investigating more in-depth code issues.  I worked closely with the Developers and DBAs to resolve issues in a timely manner and was able to advise on ways of maintaining ongoing system stability.  Other tasks included liaising with the infrastructure teams and data providers to ensure the accurate flow of data from end to end.  While working with FM, FMAs and BAs, my business knowledge of this area of finance was improved greatly.
