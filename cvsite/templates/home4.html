					<h2>Analyst Programmer/DevOps Engineer at Schroders</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Sep 2016 - Dec 2018</p>
					<p>I joined the Development Team to work as a BAU SQL developer writing reports for client guidelines.  This continued for just under a year until I volunteered to work on automating the deployment process and entered the world of DevOps in conjunction with transitioning to an Agile team.  I worked on building a CI/CD pipeline from a Git repository which triggered TFS builds and Octopus deployments to over 10 environments which included databases, services and UIs. After both .NET UI developers left the team in quick succession, I volunteered to learn the intricacies of the UI and spent my last 6 months adding new screens and controls while working closely with the business. The front end was done using npm packages in Angular 5 with model classes in C# with a SQL Server database.</p>

					<h2>Support Analyst Programmer at Schroders</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Jun 2012 - Sep 2016</p>
					<p>I transitioned to Asset Management at Schroders where I provided front office, 1st line support for the Fixed Income and Multi-Asset desks.  I worked mainly supporting FIA (Fixed Income Analytics), a custom-made application which allowed Fund Managers and other interested parties, to accurately model portfolios and monitor their performance over time, based on analytic data from several external vendors (MarkIT, Barcap, ML etc.).  FIA is built using the Microsoft toolset, so I enhanced my knowledge of SQL Server/SSIS/SSRS and was able to debug the production application and write code used to assist the support team.  For the last year I lead an offshore team and moved to level 3 support, tasked with investigating more in-depth code issues.  I worked closely with the Developers and DBAs to resolve issues in a timely manner and was able to advise on ways of maintaining ongoing system stability.  Other tasks included liaising with the infrastructure teams and data providers to ensure the accurate flow of data from end to end.  While working with FM, FMAs and BAs, my business knowledge of this area of finance was improved greatly.</p>

					<h2>Analyst Programmer at Close Brothers</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">May 2012 - Jun 2012</p>
					<p>I was contacted by an ex-boss who asked if I could help develop some reports for a month using the Microsoft toolset.  I picked up the requirements, analysed the system, quickly learnt how to develop in SSRS and SSIS, and was able to complete the work in 3 weeks.  I extend for a further month as a new tranche of work received funding.  A further offer of extension was made but I was unable to accept due to an offer for permanent work at Schroders.</p>
